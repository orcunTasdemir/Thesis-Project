For my thesis in cognitive science, I am researching Computational Social Simulation, for which I am modelling survival strategies in artificial agent-based societies, and how the chances of survival of the members would be affected by the social norms of the society.

You can access my thesis <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CYQ2lgvxFDmFtONXFs0qCZu8Etnl5qnuPo-KUwe82pI/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> 

Here are some graphs i ahve generated from my simulation study:
